# Analyzing-Amazon-sales-Data

The project focuses on analyzing Amazon sales data to uncover trends, key metrics, and factors affecting sales performance. Using the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, data is extracted from a CSV file and transformed for analysis.

Key Components:

Dataset: The analysis utilizes a dataset containing various columns, including Region, Country, Item Type, Sales Channel, and financial metrics such as Total Revenue and Total Profit.
Data Extraction: Relevant columns, such as 'Order Date' and 'Total Revenue,' are extracted into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Transformation: The 'Order Date' is converted to datetime format, and data is aggregated monthly and yearly to calculate total revenue.
Data Loading: The transformed data is organized into suitable structures for analysis.
Analysis:
Sales Trends: Monthly and yearly sales trends are examined to identify patterns.
Key Metrics: Analysis includes region-wise sales contributions, item type profitability, sales channel performance, order priority impact, and the relationship between unit prices and costs.
Forecasting: Time-series analysis techniques are applied to predict future sales based on historical data.

Conclusion:

The analysis reveals insights into sales trends and metrics that can optimize sales strategies and enhance decision-making for business growth. The report emphasizes the potential for further analysis and visualization to derive more detailed insights aligned with specific business goals.
